## Issues
I had a terrible time trying to complete this one! I first could not get the hover to work. As it turns out, I had to change up some of my existing code to get it to work properly.

Then, I had an even worse time trying to get the dropdown menu to work. As you can see, it drops down for a split second and then disappears. I had Claire and Courtney take a look at it and none of us could figure out why it's doing that. I'm assuming it's a minor error, but it's driving me crazy not to know how to fix it! I'm thinking it may have something to do with my for loop, but I'm not really sure.

Long story short, JS and I are still not friends, but we are going to work on our friendship.

Claire and Courtney were a huge help with some of my errors!
